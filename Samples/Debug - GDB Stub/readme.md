# GDB Stub Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Sega Saturn GDB stub (`srl_gdbstub.hpp`) to debug your game running on real hardware.

> [!WARNING]
> **Real Hardware Required:** This sample utilizes the USB interface on the DevCart (Wasca/Action Replay with USB). It **cannot** be run in emulators like Mednafen, Kronos, or Yabause, because they do not emulate this custom USB hardware. Attempting to run this in an emulator will likely cause it to hang or crash.

## 1. Building the Sample

To build the sample, open a terminal in this directory and run the provided make script. The `makefile` is already configured to include the `-g` flag (for debug symbols).

```bash
# From inside Samples/Debug - GDB Stub/
../../tools/scripts/make.sh
```

This will produce `./BuildDrop/Debug_GDBStub.elf` (which contains your debug symbols for GDB) and `./BuildDrop/Debug_GDBStub.bin` (which is the executable payload).

## 2. Running on the Saturn (Hardware Test Flow)

To ensure a stable upload and execution environment on real hardware, it is highly recommended to follow the clean hardware state sequence before uploading your payload:

### Optional Host Tools

Make sure these tools are installed and available in `PATH` before starting:

- [`usbreset`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/usbreset.1.html) (reset FT245R endpoint)
- [`ESP-SaturnPSU_Control`](https://github.com/willll/ESP-SaturnPSU_Control) (control power supply - esp32-saturn-psu firmware)

### Required Host Tools

Make sure these tools are installed and available in `PATH` before starting:

- [`ftx`](https://github.com/willll/ftx) (USBGamers uploader)
- `gdb-multiarch` or `sh-elf-gdb` (debugger)

Quick sanity checks:

```bash
command -v usbreset
command -v ftx
command -v gdb-multiarch
```

1. **Power Cycle:** Turn your Sega Saturn completely off and then back on (using a physical switch or your networked PSU controller, e.g., `saturnpsu.local`).
2. **Reset USB Cartridge:** Reset the state of your USB cartridge on the PC to avoid stale buffer issues:
   ```bash
   usbreset "FT245R USB FIFO"
   ```
3. **Wait:** Give the Saturn a short settle window (approx 10 seconds) after the power cycle.
4. **Probe Cartridge Link:** Verify the USB link is alive before upload:
   ```bash
   ftx -c
   ```
   If this returns `device not found`, repeat the power-cycle + `usbreset` sequence.
5. **Upload:** Use the built-in run script to upload the `.bin` payload directly to the Saturn using `ftx`:
   ```bash
   ../../tools/scripts/run.sh USBGamers
   ```

### Optional: PSU REST Automation

If you use ESP-SaturnPSU_Control at `saturnpsu.local`, you can automate a clean power cycle from the host:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://saturnpsu.local/api/v1/off
sleep 2
curl -sS -X POST http://saturnpsu.local/api/v1/on
sleep 10
usbreset "FT245R USB FIFO"
sleep 2
ftx -c
../../tools/scripts/run.sh USBGamers
```

You can also query relay state with:

```bash
curl -sS http://saturnpsu.local/api/v1/status
```

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting:** If the upload fails with `usb bulk write failed`, rerun the full sequence above (Power Cycle -> `usbreset` -> Wait 10s) before retrying the upload.

Once successfully uploaded, the code will boot, initialize the GDB stub, and execute a `trapa #3` instruction. This will immediately halt the Saturn's CPU and wait for GDB to connect.

## 3. Attaching GDB

Open a new terminal window on your PC. You need to use the SH-2 cross-compiled version of GDB, and you must pass it the `.elf` file so it knows the memory layout and symbols of your program.

```bash
# Launch GDB with the ELF file
sh-elf-gdb ./BuildDrop/Debug_GDBStub.elf
```

or with multiarch GDB:

```bash
gdb-multiarch ./BuildDrop/Debug_GDBStub.elf
```

Once inside the `(gdb)` prompt, connect to the Saturn over the `ftx` TCP interface.

```sh
ftx -g 1234 -v
```

```gdb
(gdb) set architecture sh
(gdb) set endian big
(gdb) target extended-remote host.docker.internal:1234
```

Ftx will print the communication log :

```ftx
[TCPProxy] listening on port 1234
[TCPProxy] client connected

```

and GDB will show:

```gdb
...
Connected to Saturn.
0x60044444 in main () at src/main.cxx:15
15		SRL::GDBStub::Poll();
(gdb) 
```

### Useful GDB Commands:
- `info registers`: View the state of all SH-2 CPU registers.
- `continue` or `c`: Resume game execution.
- `Ctrl-C`: Pause the running game (requires the game to periodically call `SRL::GDBStub::Poll()`, which this sample does in its main loop).
- `x/10x $pc`: Read 10 words of memory at the Program Counter.
