// This header file provides a no-op implementation of the assert macro.

#pragma once
// The `#pragma once` directive is a non-standard but widely supported preprocessor directive 
// that ensures the file is included only once within a single compilation. 
// This is used to prevent problems if the header file is accidentally included multiple times.

#define assert(expr) ((void)0)
// This line defines a macro named `assert` that takes one argument, `expr`.
// The `assert` macro is typically used to abort the program if `expr` is false.
// However, in this case, the `assert` macro does nothing, regardless of the value of `expr`.
// The expression `((void)0)` is a do-nothing statement that has no side effects.
// This implementation of `assert` is useful in release builds, where you want to disable assert checks.
