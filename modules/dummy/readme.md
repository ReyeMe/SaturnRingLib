# Dummy Headers Folder

This folder contains no-operation (no-op) versions of standard C headers for compatibility purposes. These headers include, but are not limited to, `assert.h` and `stdio.h`.

The purpose of these dummy headers is to allow code that includes these headers to compile and run, even if the functionality provided by the original headers is not needed or not available in the current environment.

Please note that these headers do not provide any of the functionality that the original headers do. They are empty placeholders. If your code relies on functionality provided by these headers, you will need to provide an implementation yourself.

## Included Headers

- `assert.h`: This header is typically used for conditionally compiled assertions in C programs. The dummy version of this header does not provide any assertion functionality.

- `stdio.h`: This header is typically used for input and output operations in C programs. The dummy version of this header does not provide any input or output functionality.
