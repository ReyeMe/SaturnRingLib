// This header file provides a no-op implementation of the printf function.

#pragma once
// The `#pragma once` directive is a non-standard but widely supported preprocessor directive 
// that ensures the file is included only once within a single compilation. 
// This is used to prevent problems if the header file is accidentally included multiple times.

#define printf(...) ((void)0)
// This line defines a macro named `printf` that takes any number of arguments (indicated by `...`).
// The `printf` function is typically used for formatted output to the stdout.
// However, in this case, the `printf` function does nothing, regardless of the arguments passed.
// The expression `((void)0)` is a do-nothing statement that has no side effects.
// This implementation of `printf` is useful in situations where you want to disable all output from printf calls,
// such as in a release build or when running unit tests.
